            <p>
                The photographer, Arica, has a passion for nature and photography.  She has traveled to many places throughout the United States to capture the beauty of nature and the special moments of people.  She has been photographing for 6 years with a focus on nature.  When she moved to Wisconsin, the high school was in need of a photographer and that is when she started photographing events, people, and milestones.  She has learned to combine the need and the nature to create beautiful photographs.
